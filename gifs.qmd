# Gifs {#sec-gifs}

In R4Epi, we use quite a few gifs. That makes rendering the book to pdf format challenging. What happens when we add a gif to a qmd document and render it to pdf?

Need to figure out how to add gifs and I also need to figure out how to tell the qmd to render in pdf format.

## Add a gif

Currently, I'm adding it in the same way I would add a video. I'm following [these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/videos.html). That document says, "In HTML formats the video will be embedded within the document. For other formats, a simple link to the video will be rendered."

Not currently working. I need to try to figure out why.
