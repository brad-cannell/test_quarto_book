# Book Options {#sec-book-options}

A collection of notes on Quarto book options.

-   [Link to list of book options](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/books.html)

-   How do you add a cover image? Look at [r4ds](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/).
    - `cover-image: cover.jpg`

-   How do you add last date rendered to the `_quarto.yml` file? "r Sys.Date()" doesn't seem to work.
