Notes on exporting the book to pdf.

Not only how to render it to pdf, but is there an option

According to [this](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-output.html#sidebar-tools), it looks like we can make a pdf downloadable by adding `downloads: [pdf, epub]` to `_quarto.yml`. In the config file for this test book, we added `downloads: pdf` to the book options section.

**Important**: It looks like the option above only creates the link on the HTML page to download the pdf version of the book. However, a new pdf version of the book isn't automatically rendered when we click the render button. You have to specifically render a pdf version separately from an html version. 

We may want to think about creating an internal file with notes and a chunk that renders html and pdf when executed. 

```{bash}
#| eval: false
quarto render
```
