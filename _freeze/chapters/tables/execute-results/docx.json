I need to add notes on creating and working with tables in this chapter. I may also want to add it to the [appendix in R4Epi](https://www.r4epi.com/appendix-alternative-table-formats. \n\nUseful websites:\n\n- [Quarto table documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.htm)\n\n\n## Test table\n\nJust quickly testing to see if it will download. Need to better document this in the future.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkey <- tribble(\n ~var, ~description,\n \"ml_age\", \"Participant's age at baseline.\",\n \"ml_gender_f\", \"Participant's self-reported sex at baseline.\",\n \"ml_race_f\", \"Participant's self-reported race at baseline.\",\n \"ml_race_eth_4cat_f\", \"Participant's self-reported race at baseline. Collapsed into four categories.\",\n \"ml_hispanic_f\", \"Participant's self-report of Hispanic ethnicity at baseline.\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nInitially, the code chunk above created a datatable version of the table. \n\n````\n```{{r}}\nDT::datatable(\n  key,\n  colnames = c(\"Variable Name\", \"Variable Description\")\n)\n```\n````\n\nWhen I tried to render the book, I got the following error:\n\n````\nError: Functions that produce HTML output found in document targeting pdf output.\nPlease change the output type of this document to HTML. Alternatively, you can allow\nHTML output in non-HTML formats by adding this option to the YAML front-matter of\nyour quarto file:\n\n  prefer-html: true\n\nNote however that the HTML output will not be visible in non-HTML formats.\n\nExecution halted\n````\n\n\n\n## Issues\n\n- Why do I get `?@tbl-demographics-overall` and how do I fix it?\n  - There may be other reasons why this error can occur, but I was getting it because [Quarto doesn't currently support table captions for datatables](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/3034). You can, however, use figure captions for datatables.",
