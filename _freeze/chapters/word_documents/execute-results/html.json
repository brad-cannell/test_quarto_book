Melissa Van Bussel has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/@ggnot2) from Posit::conf(2023) with some tips for doing this, including using `rmarkdown::pandoc_convert()`. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrmarkdown::pandoc_convert(\n  '/Users/bradcannell/Desktop/My Personal SOP.docx', \n  to = 'markdown',\n  output = here::here(\"sops\", \"my_personal_sop.qmd\")\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe still need to do a little bit of manual cleaning afterward, but it's a pretty good start.",
