Use the cloned directory.\n- In the project, create a new file titled `_quarto.yml` with the following content.\n\n\n\n```{yml}\n#| eval: false\nproject:\n  title: \"Project Name\"\n```\n\n\n\n- Create a new Quarto file named `index.qmd`. Update the yml header to look something like the following.\n\n\n\n```{yml}\n#| eval: false\n---\ntitle: \"Name on Title Slide\"\nsubtitle: \"Optional Subtitle\"\ndate: \"July 26, 2023\"\nformat: \n  revealjs:\n    css: style.css\n    preview-links: false\nlogo: uthealth_sph_logo.png\n---\n```\n\n\n\n- Notice that you can optionally add a CSS file as well. \n\n### Authoring Revealjs presentations\n\n- How do I add interactive quizzes? Use Poll Everywhere?\n\n### What I did to publish the DSHS presentation\n\n-   2023-07-26: I created these notes while trying to publish the presentation I did for Texas DSHS.\n-   When I began this process, I had already created the presentation in an R project.\n-   Create a new GitHub repo (with nothing but a README file): https://github.com/brad-cannell/dshs-2023-07-26. \n-   Create a `gh-pages` branch in GitHub.\n-   Set the repositories source branch to `gh-pages`. https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#source-branch\n  -  Settings > Pages > Deploy from branch & select gh-pages as the branch.\n-   Clone the repo to your computer.\n-   Copy and paste all of files I had already created into the newly cloned directory.\n-   Rename the qmd file that creates the presentation to `index.qmd`. The `gh-pages` branch will look for an html file named `index`.\n-   Render `index.qmd`. `quarto render` in terminal.\n-   Commit and push all of the file changes.\n-   In the terminal, type `quarto publish gh-pages`.\n-   The presentation should appear at `https://brad-cannell.github.io/dshs-2023-07-26`.\n\n",
