    "markdown": "# Cross References {#sec-crossrefs}\n\nWhen authoring the book, it is common to need to cross reference book parts (i.e., chapters, sections), figures, tables, and I'm going to go ahead and include citations here too.\n\n## Book parts\n\n[Link to the official documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-crossrefs.html). Briefly, there are two methods that I'm likely to use.\n\n### Reference a chapter\n\nFirst, you need to make a chapter/section heading available to be referenced by adding `{#sec-}` behind the header.  For example:\n\n````markdown\n# Images {#sec-images}\n````\n\nThen to reference it you type `@sec-`. For example:\n\n````markdown\nSee @sec-images to learn about images.\n````\n\nWhich looks like this: See @sec-images to learn about images.\n\n::: callout-important\n## Label Prefix\n\nIn order for a chapter to be cross-referenceable, its label must start with the `sec-` prefix.\n:::\n\nIf I don't want `@sec-images` to automatically be replaced with `Chapter 7` -- for example, I want it to say `the images chapter` instead -- then I think I will need to use hyperlinks ( below). For example,\n\n````markdown\nSee [the images chapter](../images/images.qmd)\n````\n\nWhich looks like this: See [the images chapter](../images/images.qmd)\n\n::: callout-important\n## Hyperlink file paths\n\nWhen using hyperlinks to connect chatpers/sections, make sure to use the full file path (originating from the current qmd file). For example, use `../images/images.qmd` instead of just `images.qmd`. If you change the file structure, you may break the links. This is one reason why you may want to use that `@sec-` syntax whenever possible.\n:::\n\nChapter sections work the same way. You are able to cross-reference any heading at any level. For example, \n\n## Citations\n\nBuilt-in example: See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.\n\nTo [change the citation style](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html)\n\n1. Add a CSL file to the repo. For example, this repo has a file named `ama.csl`. The [Quarto Citations and Footnotes documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) also includes links to download CSL files for a variety of citation formats.\n\n2. Update the `csl:` option in `_quarto.yml`. For example, `csl: ama.csl`.\n\nHere is what the default `@knuth84` citation above looks like after rendering this document.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![An example of Quarto's default citation style.](default_citation.png){#fig-default-citation width=4.16in}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHere is what the default `@knuth84` reference looks like after rendering this document.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![An example of Quarto's default reference style.](default_reference.png){width=3.84in}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHere is what the `@knuth84` citation above looks like after changing the citation style to AMA and rendering this document.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![An example of an AMA citation.](ama_citation.png){#fig-ama-citation width=5.21in}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHere is what the `@knuth84` reference looks like after changing the citation style to AMA and rendering this document.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![An example of an AMA reference.](ama_reference.png){#fig-ama-reference width=4.84in}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Footnotes\n\nI haven't done a lot of footnotes in the past, but [here is some documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#footnotes) in case I want to do them in the future.^[And here is an example footnote.]\n\n## Glossary\n\nFollowing the emphasizing text guidance in the [R4Epi Wiki](https://github.com/brad-cannell/r4epi/wiki/Emphasizing-Text), we sometimes want to hyperlink words that we will define in the [Glossary](../appendices/glossary.qmd). We can definitely link selected words in the narrative of the chapers to _headers_, but I haven't been able to figure out a way to link them to words in the glossary that aren't headers. Therefore, the best strategy so far seems to be to make the glossary words headers, style them with CSS, then link words in the narrative of the chapters to those headers in the glossary. \n\nFor example, let's say that we want to define the term [data frame](../appendices/glossary.qmd#glossary-data-frame) in the glossary. The first thing we do is turn the word \"data frame\" into a header and assign it an ID. For now, I'm planning to prefix all glossary IDs with the word \"glossary\" in case I need to search for them later. \n\n````markdown\n## Data frame {#glossary-data-frame}\n````\n\nNext, use a hyperlink to reference that header in the narrative of the chapter. For example, \n\n````markdown\nWe want to define the term [data frame](../appendices/glossary.qmd#glossary-data-frame) in the glossary.\n````\n\nWhich looks like this: We want to define the term [data frame](../appendices/glossary.qmd#glossary-data-frame) in the glossary.\n\nThis works, but the word \"data frame\" is numbered and styled like a section header in the glossary. That isn't the look we are going for. We can remove the numbering by adding the `.unnumbered` class to the header like this.\n\n````markdown\n## Data frame {#glossary-data-frame .unnumbered}\n````\n\nI tried to further adjust the CSS. I got it to work, but it didn't affect the PDF. So, I think it may be best just to stop here for now.\n\nThere is one additional problem. Linking to headers like that causes each term to appear in the PDF table of contents. That could get really long.\n\nThanks to [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35285467/how-to-make-a-line-below-text-without-text-decoration-underline), I think I figured out a solution. In `glossary.qmd`, write the glossary term like this.\n\n````markdown\n<a name=\"glossary-test-word\">Test word</a>\n````\n\nNext, use a hyperlink to reference that header in the narrative of the chapter. For example, \n\n````markdown\nDoes [this word](../appendices/glossary.qmd#glossary-test-word) work?\n````\n\nWhich looks like this: Does [this word](../appendices/glossary.qmd#glossary-test-word) work?\n\nThen, let's style it in the CSS file. \n\nThis works for the HTML version of the book, but not the PDF version. Specifically, the links aren't active and the css styling isn't applied.\n\n[Here is the solutions I got from Julian on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76691907/quarto-link-a-word-in-one-qmd-document-to-a-word-in-a-different-qmd-document/76719362#76719362).\n\n> Pandoc already supports [defintion lists](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#definition-lists), which for HTML output render to desciption list (<dl>) elemements. -- all credits to [salim](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/1697#issuecomment-1462441697)!\n\nSo, use the following syntax in the [glossary](#sec-glossary)\n\n````markdown\n# Glossary {.unnumbered}\n\n[Test definition]{#glossary-test-definition}\n\n:   This is a test glossary term that I'm try to reference in @sec-crossrefs without making it a header. I don't want to make it a header because that makes the table of contents really long when rendering to PDF (see [this gh issue](https://github.com/orgs/brad-cannell/projects/3/views/4?pane=issue&itemId=33310870)).\n````\n\nThen, use a hyperlink to reference that header in the narrative of the chapter. For example,\n\n````markdown\nDoes this [test definition](../appendices/glossary.qmd#glossary-test-word) work?\n````\n\nDoes this [test definition](../appendices/glossary.qmd#glossary-test-definition) work?\n",
