# Adding call out boxes

In R4Epi, we sometimes add special boxes for side notes and warnings. How do we add those into qmd books?

What do those boxes look like when we render the book to pdf format?

Does Quarto have some built-in boxes? It looks like it might?

-   How do you add the call out boxes (i.e., important, etc.)?
