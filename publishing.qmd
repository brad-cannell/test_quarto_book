# Publishing {#sec-publishing}

This chapter is about getting the book files on GitHub and creating an HTML version of the book for public consumption. I'm starting with GitHub Pages because it seems like it should be the lowest hanging fruit. 

## GitHub repository

The first step to publishing a book online is to put it into a GitHub repository. Originally, I started my book project by creating a new project, clicking new directory, then Quarto book. After creating the book project, I created a repository for it in GitHub and then tried to use GitHub's on-screen instructions to push the book files to the repo. However, I kept getting errors and wasn't ever able to make it work. I feel like this shouldn't be the case and was probably just some weird one-off. So, don't give up on that process just yet.

What I eventually got to work was this process.
- I created the repo on GitHub (with nothing but a README file) first.
- I cloned the repo to my computer. 
- I clicked new project > existing directory.
- The downside is that RStudio didn't give me the option to make it a Quarto book project.
- In the terminal, [following this guidance](https://quarto.org/docs/books/), I typed `quarto create-project test_quarto_book --type book`.
  - Make sure the terminal is set to the project's directory.
- That added all the built-in book stuff, but in a folder inside the current folder. You can move all of the files you're interested in over if you want. Since I already had the files I had been previously working with (but wasn't able to push to GitHub), I moved them over and worked with them.
