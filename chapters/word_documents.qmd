# Word Documents {sec-word-documents}

There are times when we want to convert a Word document to markdown. Melissa Van Bussel has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/@ggnot2) from Posit::conf(2023) with some tips for doing this, including using `rmarkdown::pandoc_convert()`. Here is an example:

```{r}
#| eval: false

rmarkdown::pandoc_convert(
  '/Users/bradcannell/Desktop/My Personal SOP.docx', 
  to = 'markdown',
  output = here::here("sops", "my_personal_sop.qmd")
)
```

We still need to do a little bit of manual cleaning afterward, but it's a pretty good start.
