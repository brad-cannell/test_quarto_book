Notes on parameterizing Quarto documents.

Useful websites:

- [Render parameterized reports with Quarto](https://www.jhelvy.com/posts/2023-02-28-parameterized-pdfs-with-quarto/)

We add parameters to the yaml header of the Quarto file. For example, this file has the following yaml header:

````yaml
---
params:
  test_param: "Hello World!"
---
````

We can then use that parameter in our markdown like this.

````markdown
My test parameter says, "`r params$test_param`"
````

And here is what is rendered: My test parameter says, "`r params$test_param`". 

Currently, this doesn' appear to work. However, it did work for the [L2C mater table](https://brad-cannell.github.io/l2c_master_table/). I'm not sure why. Right now, all I can come up with is that it is some difference between a Quarto book and a Quarto website. Try to figure this out later.
