# Cross References {#sec-crossrefs}

When authoring the book, it is common to need to cross reference book parts (i.e., chapters, sections), figures, tables, and I'm going to go ahead and include citations here too.

## Book parts

[Link to the official documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-crossrefs.html). Briefly, there are two methods that I'm likely to use.

### Reference a chapter

First, you need to make a chapter/section heading available to be referenced by adding `{#sec-}` behind the header.  For example:

````markdown
# Images {#sec-images}
````

Then to reference it you type `@sec-`. For example:

````markdown
See @sec-images to learn about images.
````

Which looks like this: See @sec-images to learn about images.

If I don't want `@sec-images` to automatically be replaced with `Chapter 7`, I think I will need to use hyperlinks (see [the section on hyperlinks](cross_references.qmd#hyperlinks) below).

## Controlling 

See @sec-images to learn about images. If I don't want `@sec-images` to automatically be replaced with `Chapter 7`, I think I will need to use hyperlinks (see @sec-hyperlinks below).

## Label Prefix

In order for a chapter to be cross-referenceable, its label must start with the `sec-` prefix.

## Citations

Built-in example: See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.

To [change the citation style](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html)

1. Add a CSL file to the repo. For example, this repo has a file named `ama.csl`. The [Quarto Citations and Footnotes documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) also includes links to download CSL files for a variety of citation formats.

2. Update the `csl:` option in `_quarto.yml`. For example, `csl: ama.csl`.

Here is what the default `@knuth84` citation above looks like after rendering this document.

```{r}
#| label: fig-default-citation
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: An example of Quarto's default citation style.

knitr::include_graphics("default_citation.png")
```

Here is what the default `@knuth84` reference looks like after rendering this document.

```{r}
#| label: default-reference
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: An example of Quarto's default reference style.

knitr::include_graphics("default_reference.png")
```

Here is what the `@knuth84` citation above looks like after changing the citation style to AMA and rendering this document.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ama-citation
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: An example of an AMA citation.

knitr::include_graphics("ama_citation.png")
```

Here is what the `@knuth84` reference looks like after changing the citation style to AMA and rendering this document.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ama-reference
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: An example of an AMA reference.

knitr::include_graphics("ama_reference.png")
```

## Footnotes

I haven't done a lot of footnotes in the past, but [here is some documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#footnotes) in case I want to do them in the future.^[And here is an example footnote.]

## Glossary

Following the emphasizing text guidance in the [R4Epi Wiki](https://github.com/brad-cannell/r4epi_quarto/wiki/Emphasizing-Text#keywords), we sometimes want to hyperlink words that we will define in the @sec-glossary or [Appendix -@sec-glossary] [Glossary](../appendices/glossary.qmd).
