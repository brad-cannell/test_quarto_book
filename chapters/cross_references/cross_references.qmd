# Cross References {#sec-crossrefs}

When authoring the book, it is common to need to cross reference book parts (i.e., chapters, sections), figures, tables, and I'm going to go ahead and include citations here too.

## Book parts

[Link to the official documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-crossrefs.html). Briefly, there are two methods that I'm likely to use.

### Reference a chapter

First, you need to make a chapter/section heading available to be referenced by adding `{#sec-}` behind the header.  For example:

````markdown
# Images {#sec-images}
````

Then to reference it you type `@sec-`. For example:

````markdown
See @sec-images to learn about images.
````

Which looks like this: See @sec-images to learn about images.

## Label Prefix

For a chapter to be cross-referenceable, its label must start with the `sec-` prefix.

## Chapter in _quarto.yml

For a chapter to be cross-referenceable, it must be listed in _quarto.yml.
:::

If I don't want `@sec-images` to automatically be replaced with `Chapter 7` -- for example, I want it to say `the images chapter` instead -- then I think I will need to use hyperlinks ( below). For example,

````markdown
See [the images chapter](../images/images.qmd)
````

Which looks like this: See [the images chapter](../images/images.qmd)

::: callout-important
## Hyperlink file paths

When using hyperlinks to connect chatpers/sections, make sure to use the full file path (originating from the current qmd file). For example, use `../images/images.qmd` instead of just `images.qmd`. If you change the file structure, you may break the links. This is one reason why you may want to use that `@sec-` syntax whenever possible.
:::

Chapter sections work the same way. You are able to cross-reference any heading at any level. For example, 

## Citations

To add a citation to the text of a chapter:

1. Add an entry to `references.bib` in BibTeX format.
    - The easiest way to get the BibTeX citation is probably to generate it with a reference management software like PaperPile or Zotero.

2. Use the `@referenceTitle` syntax to add the citation to your text.

For example:

````markdown
Built-in example: See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.
````

Renders as: Built-in example: See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.

### Change the citation style

To [change the citation style](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html)

1. Add a CSL file to the repo. For example, this repo has a file named `ama.csl`. The [Quarto Citations and Footnotes documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) also includes links to download CSL files for a variety of citation formats.

2. Update the `csl:` option in `_quarto.yml`. For example, `csl: ama.csl`.

Here is what the default `@knuth84` _citation_ above looks like after rendering this document.

```{r}
#| label: fig-default-citation
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: An example of Quarto's default citation style.

knitr::include_graphics("default_citation.png")
```

Here is what the default `@knuth84` _reference_ looks like after rendering this document.

```{r}
#| label: default-reference
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: An example of Quarto's default reference style.

knitr::include_graphics("default_reference.png")
```

Here is what the `@knuth84` _citation_ above looks like after changing the citation style to AMA and rendering this document.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ama-citation
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: An example of an AMA citation.

knitr::include_graphics("ama_citation.png")
```

Here is what the `@knuth84` _reference_ looks like after changing the citation style to AMA and rendering this document.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ama-reference
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: An example of an AMA reference.

knitr::include_graphics("ama_reference.png")
```

## Footnotes

I haven't done a lot of footnotes in the past, but [here is some documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#footnotes) in case I want to do them in the future.^[And here is an example footnote.]

## Glossary

Following the emphasizing text guidance in the [R4Epi Wiki](https://github.com/brad-cannell/r4epi/wiki/Emphasizing-Text), we sometimes want to hyperlink words that we will define in the [Glossary](../appendices/glossary.qmd). We can definitely link selected words in the narrative of the chapters to _headings_, but that approach creates a line in the table of contents for each word in the glossary, which isn't ideal. I posted this issue on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76691907/quarto-link-a-word-in-one-qmd-document-to-a-word-in-a-different-qmd-document/76719362#76719362). Therefore, the best strategy so far seems to be using [definition lists](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#definition-lists). 

For example, let's say that we want to define the term [data frame](../appendices/glossary.qmd) in the glossary. The first thing we do is assign and CSS ID to the word "data frame" in the glossary qmd file. For now, I'm planning to prefix all glossary IDs with the word "glossary" in case I need to search for them later. 

````markdown
[Data frame]{#glossary-data-frame} 

:  For our purposes, data frames are just R's term for data set or data table. Data frames are made up of columns (variables) and rows (observations). In R, all columns of a data frame must have the same length.
````

## Definition lists

The colon followed by two spaces before the term's definition is not optional. 
:::

Next, use a hyperlink to reference the glossary term in the narrative of the chapter. For example, 

````markdown
We want to define the term [data frame](../appendices/glossary.qmd#glossary-data-frame) in the glossary.
````

Which looks like this: We want to define the term [data frame](../appendices/glossary.qmd#glossary-data-frame) in the glossary.

Additionally, terms linked in this way should also work in PDF downloads.

If we want to adjust the style of the of the glossary term (e.g., increase the font size or make it bold), we can do so in the `.scss` file. For example,

````css
dl {
  font-size: 14pt;
  font-weight: bold;
}
````

We use `dl` because  Pandoc renders the HTML output to description list (`<dl>`) elements. This styling should also work in PDF downloads.
