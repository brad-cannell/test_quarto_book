### What I did to publish the DSHS presentation

-   2023-07-26: I created these notes while trying to publish the presentation I did for Texas DSHS.
-   When I began this process, I had already created the presentation in an R project.
-   Create a new GitHub repo (with nothing but a README file): https://github.com/brad-cannell/dshs-2023-07-26. 
-   Create a `gh-pages` branch in GitHub.
-   Set the repositories source branch to `gh-pages`. https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#source-branch
  -  Settings > Pages > Deploy from branch & select gh-pages as the branch.
-   Clone the repo to your computer.
-   Copy and paste all of files I had already created into the newly cloned directory.
-   Rename the qmd file that creates the presentation to `index.qmd`. The `gh-pages` branch will look for an html file named `index`.
-   Render `index.qmd`. `quarto render` in terminal.
-   Commit and push all of the file changes.
-   In the terminal, type `quarto publish gh-pages`.
-   The presentation should appear at `https://brad-cannell.github.io/dshs-2023-07-26`.
