# Gifs {#sec-gifs}

In R4Epi, we use quite a few gifs. That makes rendering the book to pdf format challenging. What happens when we add a gif to a qmd document and render it to pdf?

The following code works great for HTML format, but it messes up pdf format. 

````markdown
![A gif about file paths](img/file_path_gif.gif){#fig-file-paths}

And I can [cross reference](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html) the gif by typing `@fig-file-paths`. See @fig-file-paths

::: {.callout-important}
For cross-references to work, the image must have a caption _and_ a label.

````

What if I use `knitr::include_graphics("path")`?

````markdown

```{{r}}
#| label: fig-file-paths
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: |
#|   A gif about file paths.
#| fig-alt: |
#|   A gif about file paths.

knitr::include_graphics("file_path_gif.gif")
```

And I can [cross reference](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html) the figure by typing `@fig-file-paths`. See @fig-file-paths

No, this doesn't work either. [Here is a pretty good discussion on the topic](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/3551). It looks like the easiest route may be to use [conditional content](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/conditional.html). Given the limited number of gifs in R4Epi, this shouldn't be too big of a problem.

So, start by conditionally displaying the gif if the output format is html. 

````markdown

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}

```{{r}}
#| label: fig-file-paths
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: |
#|   A gif about file paths.
#| fig-alt: |
#|   A gif about file paths.

knitr::include_graphics("file_path_gif.gif")
```

:::

````

Which renders as...

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}

```{r}
#| label: fig-file-paths
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: |
#|   A gif about file paths.
#| fig-alt: |
#|   A gif about file paths.

knitr::include_graphics("file_path_gif.gif")
```

:::

Then, conditionally add a thumbnail image of the gif when the output format is pdf. 

- Create a duplicate of the gif in Finder. 
- Add "_thumb" to the end of the file name (before the file extension).
- Open the duplicate file in preview.
- Use Preview's sidebar to keep only one of the thumbnail images from the gif (select and delete the rest).
- Click File > Export and export to png. 
- Delete the duplicate gif.

````markdown

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}

```{{r}}
#| label: fig-file-paths
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: |
#|   A thumbnail of gif about file paths.
#| fig-alt: |
#|   A thumbnail gif about file paths.

knitr::include_graphics("file_path_gif.gif")
```

````

Which renders as...

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}

```{r}
#| label: fig-file-paths_thumb
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: |
#|   A thumbnail of gif about file paths.
#| fig-alt: |
#|   A thumbnail gif about file paths.

knitr::include_graphics("file_path_gif_thumb.png")
```
