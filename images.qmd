## Native Quarto figures

Here are some examples of adding figures.

![Relative Path Directions](img/directions_relative.png){#fig-directions}

And I can [cross reference](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html) the figure by typing `@fig-directions`. See @fig-directions

For cross-references to work, the image must have a caption _and_ a label.

## Adding figures with Knitr

In R4DS (link above), Hadley et al. are still using `knitr::include_graphics("path")` to insert images even though the book has been converted to Quarto documents. When using Bookdown, [Yihui gives four arguments](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/figures.html) for using `knitr::include_graphics("path")` instead of native markdown image formatting. So, we will likely continue to use them too. Here is an example image code chunk from [R4DS](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/blob/main/intro.qmd):

````
```{{r}}
#| label: fig-ds-diagram
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: |
#|   In our model of the data science process, you start with data import
#|   and tidying. Next, you understand your data with an iterative cycle of
#|   transforming, visualizing, and modeling. You finish the process 
#|   by communicating your results to other humans.
#| fig-alt: |
#|   A diagram displaying the data science cycle: Import -> Tidy -> Understand 
#|   (which has the phases Transform -> Visualize -> Model in a cycle) -> 
#|   Communicate. Surrounding all of these is Communicate.
#| out.width: NULL

knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/data-science/base.png", dpi = 270)
```
````

Here, I'm adding my own image with `knitr::include_graphics("path")`.

```{r}
#| label: fig-directions
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: |
#|   Relative Path Directions.
#| fig-alt: |
#|   An image of a store with directions

knitr::include_graphics("img/directions_relative.png")
```

And I can [cross reference](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html) the figure by typing `@fig-directions`. See @fig-directions
