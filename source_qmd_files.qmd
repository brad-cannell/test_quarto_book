# Sourcing qmd files {#sec-sourcing-qmd-files}

We can "source" or programmatically render (as opposed to interactively rendering with the `Render` button) qmd files -- including inside of code chunks in other qmd files. Here is an example code chunk.

```{r}
#| label: example-source-qmd-file
#| eval: false
quarto::quarto_render("slow_code_cached.qmd", quiet = TRUE)
```
